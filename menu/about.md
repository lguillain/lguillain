title: About Me
---
I am currently finishing up a Masters in Data Science at EPFL.
As part of my studies, I'm spending the 2020 spring semester in Boston, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

The focus of my thesis is on using Kinect Sensors to get reliable activity traces of students in Makerspaces. Then I hope to use those traces in combination with learning analytics to help students in these spaces.

During my bachelors, I spent a year in Hong Kong at HKUST as an exchange student after which I spent 3 months a research intern at KAIST, where I was able to first learn about HCI research.
