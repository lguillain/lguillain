title: About Me
---
I am student at EPFL finishing up her Msc in Data Science. 
During my bachelors, I spent a year in Hong Kong at HKUST as an exchange student after which I spent 3 months a research intern at KAIST, where I was able to first learn about HCI research.

Longterm I want to use data and computational methods to gain insight into human behavior, especially related to language accuisition and learning.

To better to this I have dipped my feet in NLP, Computer Vision and pretty much every Data Science and ML buzzword out there.

Find out more about some of the projects I worked on [here].
