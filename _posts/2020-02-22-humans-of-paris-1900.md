In this student project me and my team explored new types of visualisation and interaction with historic collection of photos by Atelier Nadar.
Nadar was a prolific photographer and cartoonist active during the 19th century. Early on he realised the potential of photography, which was just recently invented.
Our goal was to make the collection –available on [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/en/content/accueil-en?mode=desktop)– more accessible by providing background to the individuals in the photos and provide fun ways to discover people.

To bring this vision to life we used skills of scraping/data mining, Machine Learning and Image Processing as well as Web Development and UI Design.

For a full description of the project [see our class report](http://fdh.epfl.ch/index.php/Humans_of_Paris_1900).

The Github repo containing all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/lguillain/humans-of-paris-1900).
